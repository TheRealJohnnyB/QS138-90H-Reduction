The intention is to grow the DIY Electric Motorcycle community by offering ideas that can be manipulated, imroved and sent to production. 
  
# Production 
Export dwg/dxf/vector based files and use a service such as www.sendcutsend.com to laser cut your parts of your material of choice. 6061 Aluminium at 6.3mm is great option. 
Keyed shafts, sprockets, bearings etc. can be sourced from amazon, grainger (US) Surpluscenter.com (US) in metric and standard. 


Currently, you'll have to do your own research to peice meal what sprockets/chains you'll need (with correct pitch) however the stock sprocket is a 420 pitch. There are several after market sprockets you can buy to go smaller/increase pitch (520) You should be able to use a 40 pitch sprocket (that might need some grinding to make thinner) on the reduction side, then use a 50 pitch sprocket as your front sprocket (once again might require grinding as a 50 pitch sprocket is THICKER than a 520 pitch) 


Happy DIY'ing
